This is the official GitHub for the project from UC, and any updates/releases related will be here before anywhere else.

## V1.6 Guide

For reasons unknown currently, the .dll seems to have started working fine with AC running, but only with UD CE. Meaning, the injector/disabler is no longer a necessity, and this allows us to post the working .dll with no issues *while we work to improve the injector*.

Please, report ANY 'instant' or '1 game in' bans in the issues thread, or on UC.

### IMPORTANT:
- **UD CE is the only known alternative to the injector with the .dll.**
- **If you use something else, do not report bans, as we have experienced bans in testing with everything except UD CE or the injector from v1.5.**
- **https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/marvel-rivals/686797-ud-injector-ce.html <<< UD CE tested and working with .dll**
- **You will still catch fast bans using other injectors. You've been warned.**

## V1.5 Guide

**Download from the releases tab >>>>>**

### Requirements:
- **You must disable UAC before using this cheat, otherwise you will get banned**
- **Do not use your own injector, even with the manual AC disable method, you will get banned**
- **Do not report bans if you didn't follow the steps**
- Place both the injector and .dll in the same folder, if you rename the dll you must select it before injection

### Instructions:
1. Open the game (from the .bat file for UAC disabled, if playing through LoadingBay)
2. Once at the main menu, launch the injector
3. Press Enter
4. Confirm that the injector says success
5. Menu will open top left on injection
6. Menu key is "Insert"

### Warning:
- **Please ensure you have deleted the AMD fidelity file before injection.** Steam has been known to reinstall it at times. Guide on UC. Same for the .bat file and launch args for UAC

### Usage Warning:
- If you use Bullet TP with high FOV you will get banned fast
- If you use Bullet TP with low FOV you will get banned slightly slower
- **If you are smart, use it sparsely**
- **If you are dumb, RIP bozo**
