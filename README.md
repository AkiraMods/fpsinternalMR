# V1.6 Guide
For reasons unknown currently, the .dll seems to have started working fine with AC running, but only with UD CE. Meaning, the injector/disabler is no longer a necessity, and this allows us to post the working .dll with no issues *while we work to improve the injector*
Please, report ANY 'instant' or '1 game in' bans in the issues thread, or on UC.
# IMPORTANT:
# UD CE IS THE ONLY KNOWN ALTERNATIVE TO THE INJECTOR WITH THE .DLL.
# IF YOU USE SOMETHING ELSE, DO NOT REPORT BANS, AS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BANS IN TESTING WITH EVERYTHING EXCEPT UD CE OR THE INJECTOR FROM V1.5.

# YOU WILL STILL CATCH FAST BANS USING OTHER INJECTORS. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

# YOU MUST DISABLE UAC BEFORE USING THIS CHEAT, OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET BANNED
# DO NOT USE YOUR OWN INJECTOR, EVEN WITH THE MANUAL AC DISABLE METHOD, YOU WILL GET BANNED
# DO NOT REPORT BANS IF YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THE STEPS
